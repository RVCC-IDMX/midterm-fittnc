I recently saw this place while driving down to my parents house and decided to try it, and it did not disappoint. I loved the tofu dish. It was nice and soft yet packing with flavor.

            <div class="content">From the looks of it outside this place looks pretty cool but a bit intimitating. However, I came here with my wife and two kids and I've gotta say. This place is very welcoming, the staff, food, and even certain accommodations. They adjust the spice level to those of children making sure they have a good first impression.</div>
